                <b>1. Flashback</b>
                <p>
                    The retirement problem chapter has laid down a learning path to understand personal finance. We know now that to build a retirement corpus, long-term investments in mutual funds is inevitable. Given the pivotal role mutual funds plays in defining our financial welfare, it is completely justified to spend some time to learn about mutual funds. The learning that I’m talking about is something that goes beyond normal mutual fund investors would know. The objective here is to help you know the basics plus a little more. Hence, the topics I’d like to cover here are –
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is a mutual fund?
                    </li>
                    <li>Who runs a mutual fund and why?</li>
                    <li>Regulatory aspects around a mutual fund from an MF investor’s perspective
                    </li>
                    <li>The different types of mutual funds – Equity, Debt, FoF, Hybrid, Liquid
                    </li>
                    <li>How to analyze a mutual fund? – Risk, return, ratios, exposure
                    </li>
                    <li>Factors that matter – MF ranking, Direct vs Regular, Growth vs Dividend
                    </li>
                    <li>Setting long term return and risk expectations
                    </li>
                    <li>Constructing goal-based mutual fund portfolios
                    </li>
                    <li>Logistics – SIP, SWP, STP, CAS statements, DEMAT vs non-DEMAT mode
                    </li>
                    <li>Tracking investments
                    </li>
                    <li>Mutual fund taxation
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Of course, I will add more topics if there is a need for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given this, let us get started on the very first topic i.e. to understand what a “mutual fund” really means.


                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m making an assumption here that you know nothing about mutual funds. I’m assuming that this is your very first attempt to learn about mutual funds, hence we are starting from scratch. You can skip this chapter if you know what a mutual fund is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before we start learning about Mutual funds, I’d like to digress a bit and narrate a personal story dating back to 2008-09.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m not sure how many of you reading this were trading, investing, tracking or remotely connected to the stock markets in the year 2008. The year 2008 was very interesting (perhaps scary) for people sitting on the sidelines and watching all the action, but for people involved and had their livelihoods tied to the market, 2008 was apocalyptic.  The financial services industry was in absolute pits, and I was in the city of London, which was the epicentre of the financial meltdown. I was relatively new in the industry, had very few industry connections, and hardly any working experience in the UK. When the industry-wide job cuts started, I knew it would be me sooner or later.  The good thing was I just dint sit on the sideline wondering if I would get the layoff notice. I knew it was a matter of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the situation, I had decided to head back to India. Of course, not that there many options for me to choose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By Feb 2009, I was back in Bangalore, luckily I found myself a spot to sit and trade the markets with the (now) legendary Kamath Associates (pre-Zerodha days). Soon, I was in the thick of the action and I was trading anything and everything that moved on the Indian exchanges.


                </p>
                <p>
                    The capital to trade was mainly my own plus a bit from my close circle.


                </p>
                <p>
                    While trading was something I enjoyed, I found investing super interesting. I spent a lot of time reading the annual reports and understanding of businesses. This effort included learning a bit of accounting to help me read the company’s financial statements. I soon realized that stock picking and building long-term equity portfolio was something that I wanted to do for a living.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I slowly branched out from active trading and started building an investing practice. I moved out of Kamath Associates to do this full time. Of course, at that point, Kamath Associates dissolved and Nithin Kamath started Zerodha.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time I built a carefully crafted equity portfolio for myself. I had a thesis for each investment made. I was aware of the growth drivers and the risk parameters for each stock I had invested.


                </p>
                <p>
                    While I started doing this for myself, I soon extended my help in setting up an equity portfolio for my family members and later to my close friends. I had few things going right for me and soon people around me and their immediate circle knew I was a good option to consider for equity investing. It was in November 2010, that I decided to do this as a profession.


                </p>
                <p>
                    My idea was to help people build an equity portfolio, manage it on their behalf, grow it, review it periodically, assess the risk, and do everything possible with a single point agenda – to help them generate wealth over a long period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In short, I wanted to be a ‘Fund Manager’, help people build wealth by investing their money in the stock market.


                </p>
                <p>
                    I continued my journey, by 2012, I was fortunate enough to onboard a bunch of clients and managed a decent sum of money. I was taking an independent decision on which stock to invest in and which stocks to exit. I was deciding how much to invest in each stock and for how long. On the first Saturday of every month, I’d send a report to all my clients informing them of how their portfolio was performing in the market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was indeed a fund manager for at least 20-25 families, and I felt happy and responsible being in that position.
