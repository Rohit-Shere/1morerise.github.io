            Why Should You Invest?
        </h1>
        <div class="para">
            <p>
                <b>
                Before we address the above question, let us understand what would happen if one chooses not to invest.
                Let us assume you earn Rs.50,000/- per month, and you spend Rs.30,000/-towards your cost of living,
                which includes housing, food, transport, shopping, medical, etc. The balance of Rs.20,000/- is your
                monthly surplus. For the sake of simplicity, let us ignore the effect of personal income tax in this
                discussion.
            </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                To drive the point across, let us make a few simple assumptions.
            </p>

            <p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li> The employer is kind enough to give you a 10% salary hike every year.</li>
                <li> The cost of living is likely to go up by 8% year on year.</li>
                <li> You are 30 years old and plan to retire at 50. This leaves you with 20 more years to earn</li>
                <li> You don’t intend to work after you retire.</li>
                <li> Your expenses are fixed and don’t foresee any other expense.</li>
                <li> The balance cash of Rs.20,000/- per month is retained in the form of hard cash.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                Going by these assumptions, here is how the cash balance will look like in 20 years.


            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="./img/i-1.png" alt="">
            </p>
            <p>
                If one were to analyze these numbers, you would soon realize this is a scary situation to be in. Few things are quite startling from the above calculations:
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="./img/i-2.png" alt="">
            </p>
            <p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>	After 20 years of hard work you have accumulated Rs.1.7Crs.</li>
                    <li>	Since your expenses are fixed, your lifestyle has not changed over the years, you probably even suppressed your lifelong aspirations – better home, a better car, vacations, etc.</li>
                    <li>
                        	After you retire, assuming the expenses will continue to grow at 8%, Rs.1.7Crs is good enough to sail you through roughly about 8 years of post-retirement life. 8th year onwards you will be in a very tight spot with literally no savings left to back you up.
                    </li>

                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                What would you do after you run out of all the money in 8 years? How do you fund your life? Is there a way to ensure that you collect a larger sum at the end of 20 years?
            </p>
            <p>Let’s consider another scenario where instead of keeping the cash idle, you choose to invest the cash in an investment option that grows at let’s say 12% per annum. For example – in the first year you retained Rs.240,000/- which when invested at 12% per annum for 20 years yields Rs.2,067,063/- at the end of 20th year.</p>
